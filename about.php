						<p>So we've all been there.  You need a little help.  Just a nudge in the right direction.  Maybe you've been doing a bunch of researching and just need some real-world advice to start turning all the random data in your head into some practical knowledge.  Perhaps you've been spending your time scouring the internet and soaking up information, and now you need a few tips to get started practicing on your own.  Or maybe you're so buried in a huge, complicated project that you just can't remember that one silly command parameter that no one ever uses anyway.  You could hunt through the man pages for ages until you stumble across it, or you could save oodles of time and just ask someone.  It's far more efficient, and they might be able to suggest a better alternative anyway.  So you pop into an IRC channel and ask your question. Surely there's no harm in that...until the responses start rolling in:</p>
						<ul>
							<li> &lt;X3N0F0B3&gt; GTFO N00B! </li>
							<li> &lt;lazy&gt; GOOGLE IT! </li>
							<li> &lt;Narcileptic&gt; What an idiot! Who asks something so stupid?</li>
							<li> &lt;a55h0l3&gt; JFGI, Tard! </li>
							<li> &lt;d3r0gatory&gt; Ur N0t 1337! </li>
							<li> &lt;leet1st&gt; Go ask google! </li>
							<li> &lt;Hax0r&gt; Can an Op kick this N00b plox? </li>
							<li> &lt;0_KaOs&gt; What a waste, go fucking google. </li>
							<li> &lt;Sk1dd13&gt; Ima hax0r u, fkn nub </li>
							<li> &lt;PSVAGRSV&gt; I bet google could tell you </li>
							<li> &lt;MissChiff&gt; Duh, you just press alt+F4, dumbass. </li>
							<li> &lt;litebulb&gt; We're not here to Spoonfeed you! </li>

						<p> We get it.  That garbage gets old, right?  We sure thought it did.  So rather than fight the status quo, we decided to start a new one.  Thus, ##Spoonfed was born.  We're a growing community of administrators, security professionals, techies, hackers, and all around geeks.  Our goal is to help you find that middle ground of technology, where the rubber of theory starts meeting the road of the real-world.  You'll find plenty of resources here to help you throughout your learning, whether you're just getting into computers, hitting some trouble managing a corporate network, or want to bounce some hacking ideas around while you pen-test an enterprise.  You can stop in our channel for some friendly chat, ask some questions, or just hang out and lurk, because every channel needs a resident creeper or 3...  We'll also be hosting tutorials and linking to our favorite tools and resources, so be sure to use and abuse the Knowledge Portal as well!  So kick back, steal some knowledge, share some knowledge, and most importantly HAVE FUN!!!  </p>
